KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_MARK_ALLE=applyes the action written on the button on the left side onto all neurons
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_MARK_NEURON=mark or unmark the actual neuron
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_STD_LADEN=this provides the possibility to load existing channel definitions from a channel definition file (*.knl) into the channel list. per default these files are stored in .\parameter. all channel definitions in the chosen file are loaded into the channel actually displayed. this channel and the following (in any) are overwritten. to load definitions in addition to existing ones, you should check the box below or, if necessary, go to the last channel in the list, create a new one and than load the knl-file. the overwriting of definitions seems to be unnecessary and avoidable, but this makes you able to actualize/synchronize existing definition sets simply by loading into the first channel.  to prevent unpredictable results, all names has to be unique (provide the existing definitions with distinct appendices or open the knl-file with a text editor, check names and change them if necessary). 
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_STD_LADEN_IN_MARKIERTE=if checked and the button above is pressed, definition(s) are appended at the end of the channel list of marked neurons without overwriting anything.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_IDCANCEL=cancel all changes and restore the state before the dialogbox was opened. only channel definitions that have been saved to knl-file will remain.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_STD_SPEICHERN=saves the channel definitions to a knl-file in ".\Parameter"
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_NEU=creates a new channel and inserts it after the actual channel in the channel list with all values set to 0.0. a channel is only included in current calculation of a neuron if the conductance is larger than 0.0. if form parameters are 0 the channel is thought to be undefined and will not be stored if channel are saved to file for example.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_LOESCHEN=deletes the actual (displayed) channel and, if necessary, the corresponding inactivating part. the first channel is not deletable, if here exists a definition, simply set conductance to 0.0 to prevent any effect and/or set form parameter to 0 to prevent the message that there are user defined channels
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_MARKIERTE=as user defined channels are individual for each neuron, there might be neurons that have many whereas others have none. for this reason channels are identified by their name, i.e. if you press this button, then madSim will check every marked neuron whether it has a channel with an identical name (all charakters, even blancs at the end!) and, if this is the case his definition will be changed to the actually displayed values. to make all changes become valid, press "apply all changes". if you quit this dialog by pressing cancel, then this changes will not take effekt.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_GECHECKTE=same as the button above, but only checked parameters will be updated in channels with the same name in all marked neurons. unchecked parameters will keep their former values.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_OK=apply all changes. changes will take effect only if you press this button. if you cancel the dialog, all changes will be lost and the neurons will be restored to the state just before opening the dialog, only channel definitions that have been saved to knl-file will remain.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_1=the equilibrium potential reflects the ion type and the concentration differences across the membrane, i.e. between inside and outside the neuron
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_2=this conductance is the maximum conductance G(max) through all channels of this type in this neuron. it will only be reached, if the open state of the gate (and a 2nd gate of this channel respectively) is 1, otherwise it is lower, because it is multiplicated with the calculated gate-open-faktor m, which depends on the membrane potential. (m lies between 0 and 1 and will be calculated by a differential equation using the displayed parameter values). together with the membrane potential E(M) and the equilibrium potential E(E) the actual current of this channel can be calculated as:\n    I = U / R  ->  I = U * G  ->  I(CH) = (E(M) - E(E)) * (G(max) * m).\n\nspecifying 0 as the conductance will prevent the channel from being included in current calculation during simulation, i.e. that will switch of the channel.\n\nby the way, you might switch off the standard channels (Na, K and Ca) in the neuron "physiologic parameters..." dialog by setting this neuron to "non spiker" or specifying 0.0 to all three conductances.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_3=number of (function-)elements the channel consits of or the number of different channel states the channel might take in.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_4=the differential equation needs to have an initial value for the gate-open-faktor to start it's calculation. normaly, a good idea is to set this value to 0.0 because most voltage gated channels are closed at resting potential. if you specify a value > 0.0 the membrane potential will change immidiately (witout any other influences like electrical stimuli or synaptic activity) due to the current that will flow through the channel (look also at "conductance"). this will provide you an ability to create an initial depolarization with subsequent action potential if conductance is sufficent.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_5=form parameter is a number, that specifies a formula for the calculation of A and B in the exponential euler methode to numerically calculate the differential equation.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_5_BOX=list of available form parameters.\nk:       rate constant\nW:     1   (except 27: W = (Ca2+ conc. const.) + [Ca2+])\nE:       membrane potential (soma)\nV0:    half maximum potential\ns:       stepwidth\n\nthe real meaning of k, V0 and s depends on the model-type, i.e. how A and B are calculated (s. below at "calculate A and B (model type)")
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_6=rate constant vary with voltage but not with time and has a dimension of 1/s.  rate constant alpha determines the rate of transfer from outside to inside, while rate constant beta determines the transfer in the opposite direction.
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_7=potential in V, where half the channels are open
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_8=defines the middle of the range, where the gate variable varies between 0 and 1 in V
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_9=see form parameter alpha
KANAL_EIGENSCHAFTEN_A_B_BERECHNEN_1=to calculate differential equation values approximately by exponential euler methode, the equation has to have the form:\n      da/dt = B - A * a      with a = gate open factor (0 - 1)\ndepending on the model type there are different ways to calculate A and B.\n\nif you don't know, which one to choose for your purposes, use standard channels for sodium, potassium and calcium (sorry!).
KANAL_AKTIVIERENDER_TEIL=the overall state of some channels depend not only on one, but on to gates, the activating and inactivating gate like in the voltage gated sodium channel. these gates has to be calculated independently and therefore there are two sets of parameters necessary to calculate the open state of both channel parts. the parameter definition set of the inactivating part has to follow directly after the activating part in the channel list.
KANAL_SYNAPSE_ID=if the box in this field is checked, you can specify a synapse (by synapse ID). transmitter release of this synapse will then activate the channel. in other words: the actual synaptic state (open state) will be multiplied by the actual coductance of the channel. this means that the current through the channel is zero, if the synapse does not release transmitter. if the praesynaptic neuron exceeds the transmitter release threshold, than current will flow depending on the other properties of the channel, weighted by the synapse open state. if the channel is closed, then maximum transmitter release (i.e. open state = 100%) has no effect yet.\nattention: synaptic delay and conductance will be set to minimum values. the former values will be lost.

// dialog box to edit synaptic parameters
SYNAPSE_NEU_PARENT_COMBOBOX=praesynaptic (parent-) neuron
SYNAPSE_NEU_TARGET_COMBOBOX=postsynaptic (target-) neuron
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_NATRIUM=excitatory synapse, transmitter dependend sodium channels will be opened in postsynaptic membrane
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_KALIUM=inhibitory synapse, transmitter dependend potassium channels will be opened in postsynaptic membrane
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_CHEMISCH=userdefined synapse, effect depends on potential definition of the appropriate synaptic type
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_ELEKTRISCH=unidirectional elektrical connection
SYNAPSE_NEU_KONTAKTORT=target area on postsynaptic neuron (soma or dendrite segment)
SYNAPSE_NEU_POTENTIAL=equilibrium potential (to change potential change synaptic type or create a new one. don't forget to assign changes to the synapse)
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_COMBOBOX=the synaptic type definition specifies the equilibrium potential and assign it to a unique name. in certain cases (axo-axonic synapses for example) it can be necessary to define different types having the same potential. I will remind you if this should be done
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_NEU=create new synaptic type as defined by the displayed name and potential\nfor general synaptic type administration see dialog "synaptic types" (main menu "settings")
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_EDIT=edit synaptic type
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_ZUWEISEN=if you want to change synaptic type (to change potential for example) you have to assign the change. otherwise changes are only applyed to synaptic type definition and not to the actually edited synapse
SYNAPSE_NEU_TYP_LOESCHEN=delete synaptic type
SYNAPSE_NEU_DELAY=synaptic delay. this parameter includes both, time for synaptic transmission and axonal (action-)potential propagation
SYNAPSE_NEU_LEITFAEHIGKEIT=synaptic strength
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRT=threshold of parent neuron soma potential for transmitter release. the soma potential is assumed not to be changed by axonal propagation but only delayed
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRS=parent neuron soma potential for maximum transmitter release. further depolarization beyond this potential will not increase transmitter release any more. transmitter release is changed linearly between release threshold and saturation potential.\nto change release dynamics use the possibilities given below. if you don't know why to do that, don't do it!
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRD_VERZOEGERUNG=this will prolonge the time of transmitter release by the specified duration, i.e. if duration is 0.3 s the transmitter release will last (roughly) 0.3s if preasynaptic membrane potential is depolarized for a short time (action potential for example). increasing and decreasing part are symmetrically. an increase of depolarization time will also increase synaptic strength, because full magnitude - as specified at "conductance" - is reached only after the specified prolongation (0.3s in this example). in this case rather use the calibration factor to adjust synaptic strength rather than "conductance". this function provides a relatively fast way to modulate time course of transmitter release. higher flexibility (particularly if increase and decrease-parts should be different in slope) is available through "dynamics of transmitter release" below.
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRD_VERZOEGERUNGSFAKTOR=prolongation time
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRD_VERZOEGERUNGSGEWICHTUNG=synaptic strength calibration
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRD_BOX=dynamics of transmitter release are modeled by differential equation where increasing and decreasing part can be adjusted individually. unfortunately the parameters of differential equations are not intuitively self explaning. for this reason the dialog provides a test window, where the effects onto the time course of the synapse open-factor are displayed, assuming a "standard action potential" (as defined in "parameter\standardap.txt") is entering the synapse. compared to "transmitter release prolongation" the effort of calculation time is considerable.
SYNAPSE_NEU_TRD=trd
SYNAPSE_NEU_BAHNUNG_BOX=enable synaptic facilitation/depression
SYNAPSE_NEU_BAHNUNG=synaptic facilitation settings
SYNAPSE_NEU_SYNAPSE_LOESCHEN=delete synapse
SYNAPSE_NEU_OKF1=apply all changes and start simulation
SYNAPSE_NEU_OK=apply all changes
SYNAPSE_NEU_CANCEL=cancel all changes\nchanges made to synaptic types still remains
